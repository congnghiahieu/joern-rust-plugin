Joern Sample Extension
======================

The Joern Git Extension is a minimal example of an extension. It reads
a git history using a Java library and tags nodes of files that have
recently been modified. The main purpose of this extension is to
provide an example that shows how Joern extensions can be developed
and tested in the IntelliJ IDE. The extension is written in Scala and
makes use of the Java library jgit.
